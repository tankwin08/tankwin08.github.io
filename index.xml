      <description>Introduction The image on the right was obtained from here.
There is a lack of public available datasets on financial services and specially in the emerging mobile money transactions domain. Financial datasets are important to many researchers and in particular to us performing research in the domain of fraud detection. Part of the problem is the intrinsically private nature of financial transactions, that leads to no publicly available datasets.
A synthetic dataset were generated using the simulator called PaySim.</description>

      <description>Introduction Bayesian NN How much confidence do you know about your model results or a paritcular prediction?
This is a critical important question for many business. With the advent of deep learning, many forecasting problems for business have been solved in innovative ways. For example, Uber researchers has provided a fascianting paper on time series prediction.
Standard deep learning method such as LSTM do not capture model uncertianty. However, the uncertianty estimation is indispensable for deep learning models.</description>

ARIMA analysis will focus on the logic of model and how to select the three important terms of the model: p is the order of the AR term,
q is the order of the MA term, d is the number of differencing required to make the time series stationary.</description>

      <description>Introduction:
Genealy, it require an amount of data to train and a long time to train a NLP model for a specific dataset. Transfer learning is commonly used in this case to conduct the sentiment analsis for Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem.
Swivel performs approximate factorization of the point-wise mutual information matrix via stochastic gradient descent. It uses a piecewise loss with special handling for unobserved co-occurrences, and thus makes use of all the information in the matrix.</description>

      <description>Introduction:
Ensemble modeling is a process where multiple diverse models are created to predict an outcome, either by using many different modeling algorithms or using different training data sets. The ensemble model then aggregates the prediction of each base model and results in once final prediction for the unseen data. The motivation for using ensemble models is to reduce the generalization error of the prediction. As long as the base models are diverse and independent, the prediction error of the model decreases when the ensemble approach is used.</description>

Introduction:
A wealth of Full Waveform (FW) LiDAR data are available to the public from different sources, which is poised to boost the extensive application of FW LiDAR data. However, we lack a handy and open source tool that can be used by potential users for processing and analyzing FW LiDAR data. To this end, we introduce waveformlidar, an R package dedicated to FW LiDAR processing, analysis and visualization as a solution to the constraint.</description>

      <description>Introduction:
The picture of Bayesian optimization is obtianed from here
Bayesian optimization
There are a lot of hyperparameters for machine learning models such as NN. Typically, random or grid search are effecient ways to conduct the optimization of models. They can be very time-consuming in some cases which waste time on unpromising areas of search space. Bayesian optimization can overcome this problem by adopting an informed seach method in the space to find the optmized parameters.</description>

      <description>Introduction:
Small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have emerged as high-throughput platforms for the collection of high-resolution image data over large crop fields to support precision agriculture and plant breeding research. At the same time, the improved efficiency in image capture is leading to massive datasets, which pose analysis challenges in providing needed phenotypic data.
To complement these high-throughput platforms, there is an increasing need in crop improvement to develop robust image analysis methods to analyze large amount of image data.</description>

      <description>Introduction:
The Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) launched on September 15th, 2018 and this mission offers an extraordinary opportunity to contribute to an assessment of forest resources at multiple spatial scales. This study served to develop a methodology for utilizing ICESat-2 data over vegetated areas.

      <description>Introduction:
Full waveform (FW) LiDAR holds great potential for retrieving vegetation structure parameters at a high level of detail, but this prospect is constrained by practical factors such as the lack of available handy processing tools and the technical intricacy of waveform processing.
Methods:
This study introduces a new product named the Hyper Point Cloud (HPC), derived from FW LiDAR data, and explores its potential applications, such as tree crown delineation using the HPC-based intensity and percentile height (PH) surfaces, which shows promise as a solution to the constraints of using FW LiDAR data.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Quantifying Standing Dead Tree Structural Loss with Reconstructed Tree Models Using Voxelized Terrestrial Lidar Data</title>
      <link>/publications/terrestrail_lidar_scan/</link>

      <description>Introduction:
The structural loss rates of standing dead trees (SDTs) affect a variety of processes of interest to ecologists and foresters, yet the decomposition of SDTs has been traditionally characterized by qualitative decay classes, reductions in wood density as decay progresses, and sampling schemes focused on estimating snag longevity.
By establishing a methodology to accurately and efficiently quantify SDT structural loss over time, these estimated structural loss rates would improve the performance of a variety of models and potentially provide new insight as to the manner in which SDTs undergo degradation in various conditions.</description>

 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;rdquo; attack.</description>
