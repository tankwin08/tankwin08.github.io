      <description>Introduction Bayesian NN How much confidence do you know about your model results or a paritcular prediction?
This is a critical important question for many business. With the advent of deep learning, many forecasting problems for business have been solved in innovative ways. For example, Uber researchers has provided a fascianting paper on time series prediction.
Standard deep learning method such as LSTM do not capture model uncertianty. However, the uncertianty estimation is indispensable for deep learning models.</description>

      <description>Introduction ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average) ARIMA can explain the time series pattern for given frequency or lag (hour, day and week &amp;hellip;) and also predict furhter values.
ARIMA analysis will focus on the logic of model and how to select the three important terms of the model: p is the order of the AR term,
q is the order of the MA term, d is the number of differencing required to make the time series stationary.</description>
