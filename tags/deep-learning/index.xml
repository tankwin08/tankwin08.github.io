      <description>Introduction:
Ensemble modeling is a process where multiple diverse models are created to predict an outcome, either by using many different modeling algorithms or using different training data sets. The ensemble model then aggregates the prediction of each base model and results in once final prediction for the unseen data. The motivation for using ensemble models is to reduce the generalization error of the prediction. As long as the base models are diverse and independent, the prediction error of the model decreases when the ensemble approach is used.</description>

      <description>Introduction:
Small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have emerged as high-throughput platforms for the collection of high-resolution image data over large crop fields to support precision agriculture and plant breeding research. At the same time, the improved efficiency in image capture is leading to massive datasets, which pose analysis challenges in providing needed phenotypic data.
To complement these high-throughput platforms, there is an increasing need in crop improvement to develop robust image analysis methods to analyze large amount of image data.</description>
