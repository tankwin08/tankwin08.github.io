      <description>Objective: The aim of this project is to distingulish if a person was infeacted with the Malaria from a microscopic image, and provide support for the lab examination results to quickly diagnosis the Malaria parasites.
Malaria Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. The parasites are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, called &amp;ldquo;malaria vectors.&amp;rdquo;
Generally, the first symptoms of Malaria is fever, headache, and chills, but these symptoms usually appear after 10-15 days after the infective mosquito bite.</description>

      <description>Introduction Bayesian NN How much confidence do you know about your model results or a paritcular prediction?
This is a critical important question for many business. With the advent of deep learning, many forecasting problems for business have been solved in innovative ways. For example, Uber researchers has provided a fascianting paper on time series prediction.
Standard deep learning method such as LSTM do not capture model uncertianty. However, the uncertianty estimation is indispensable for deep learning models.</description>
