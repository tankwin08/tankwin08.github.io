      <description>Introduction Bayesian NN How much confidence do you know about your model results or a paritcular prediction?
This is a critical important question for many business. With the advent of deep learning, many forecasting problems for business have been solved in innovative ways. For example, Uber researchers has provided a fascianting paper on time series prediction.
Standard deep learning method such as LSTM do not capture model uncertianty. However, the uncertianty estimation is indispensable for deep learning models.</description>

      <description>The subsquent section is mainly to show how to quantify the uncertaity of waveform processing uinsg Bayesian method. The detailed description of the approach can refer to https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319018940_Bayesian_decomposition_of_full_waveform_LiDAR_data_with_uncertainty_analysis
In the domain of LiDAR applications, the observations or data are inherently subject to various errors such as system setting, system calibration, and range measurement errors. Additionally, the LiDAR vendors often do not clearly state what errors are considered when the data are provided.</description>
