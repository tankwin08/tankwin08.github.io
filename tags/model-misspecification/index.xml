      <description>Introduction Bayesian NN How much confidence do you know about your model results or a paritcular prediction?
This is a critical important question for many business. With the advent of deep learning, many forecasting problems for business have been solved in innovative ways. For example, Uber researchers has provided a fascianting paper on time series prediction.
Standard deep learning method such as LSTM do not capture model uncertianty. However, the uncertianty estimation is indispensable for deep learning models.</description>
